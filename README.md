The sign up page will contain a translucent background to produce a clean and contrast layout for the input edit text field for the user particulars. The input text field will be located near the centre of the screen to allow better user interaction with the mobile application. A back button is also provided at the top left corner of the screen in case users need to change the login method into the system.

The design concept for the side navigation is to have two portions of interfaces divided in vertical manner. For the top portion of the navigation menu, usersâ€™ profile images and their particulars with the theme background will be displayed. For the middle portion of the navigation menu, the features of Eco mobile application will be presented for the user to navigate between the pages. For the bottom portion of the navigation menu, contact us and settings will be provided to the user.
The size of the navigation menu is fixed between 4-7 items to allow users to quickly locate the menu items during search and it is a good practice when developing a menu list.

The home of adult mode consists of a map function that detects surrounding locations via GPS. On the top of the map section, there is a search bar for users to search for specific locations. It is designed on top so that users can easily navigate to the top searching bar. There are also three side buttons located at the right side of the application to allow users to change view, enable traffic, and relocate their position of GPS.

The schedule page will display the time of garbage and recycle collection time. It is designed in table form for users to view the time data in a more organized and easily observable manner. There is also a refresh button at the bottom of the schedule table to allow users to refresh the schedule data. The top right corner of the schedule page contains a button that allows the user to navigate into a different page that allows the user to set reminders for the selected time, it is designed in yellow colour to highlight the reminder feature to the user.
The reminder page contains two recycler views that each contain respective time and switch that allow users to turn on their notification on the date that they wished to receive the remainder. After the switch has been pushed, the colour will be changed to green and a toast will be sent to indicate a reminder set.

The recyclable and non-recyclable page provide users with a search function at the top of the page to allow users to easily locate the search bar, and the recycle/non-recyclable items are represented in a vertical list to allow users to scroll up and downwards for other items in the list. For the capture image page, an image scanner is provided and the user can click on either capture to get access to the camera, or gallery to retrieve photos. After that, the image preview will be displayed at the top middle section of the screen and the user can scan the image to get the type of recyclable material of the object.

The news and homepages have similar design as they consist of an upper navigation bar and a bottom items layout section. The navigation bar is designed on the upper section of the screen with a green indicator of the current navigation tab. The navigation bar and the layout section are designed to show in different orientation, where horizontal list is used for navigation bar and vertical view is used for layout section in order to separate the two modules and have a clear distinction between the two sections of contents.
